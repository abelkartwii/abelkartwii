### üçã what I am
I explore data and humans ‚Äî mostly separately, occassionally together, sometimes with the environment.

There are so many things within (and outside of) those realms that I still haven't learned, and so my interests reflect a broad scope of topics. Right now they converge around **data engineering**, distributed systems, microservices, **tech ethics**, feminism, **climate change**, and many others. I've thought a lot about pipelines and how data can be reprocessed and by people, how data can illustrate complex truths in our world, as well as the power of tech and how we can leverage it for the environment.

### üçé what I do
**Currently**, I am a sophomore at Green River Community College pursuing an associate's degree in arts. I am a senator in the student senate and also spend my time as part of the student life activities board where I create events that spark joy for the community. 

**In my free time**, I...
- am on my feet running 30 miles per week (all of them done easy!) 
- [read](https://www.goodreads.com/belzki) books on any interest of mine -- my goal is to read 41 books in 2021 (20 + 21)
- learn [languages](https://duome.eu/chaleurhumaine) (the human kind here) -- a pipe dream of mine is to learn one language from each major language family. currently, I am making progress in Vietnamese and Swahili while working on my French listening comprehension!
