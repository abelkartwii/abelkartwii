#### 🍋 what I do
I am an aspiring data engineer that loves to see data get up and move! I have a penchant for open-source software and try my best to use them in my projects whenever possible.

My main interests are distributed systems and cloud computing, and I plan on doing research in either field whenever I transfer to a university. Martin Kleppmann's Designing Data-Intensive Applications was the book that made me fell in love with the field, and I have read the book twice by now.

#### 🍎 extracurriculars
At my community college, I am a senator in the student senate's public relations committee. I am also a member of the activities board where we plan a bunch of cool stuff for everyone to attend. 

Aside from that, I am on my feet running 30 miles per week, most of them done easy. 
I have a huge interest in **languages** as well, both human and programming. I have a pipe dream of learning one language from each major language family, and if I spend a year focusing on just one language, I will be done by 2035 😨
