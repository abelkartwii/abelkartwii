### üçã what I do
I am an aspiring data engineer that loves to see data do data stuff! I have a penchant for open-source software and try my best to use them in my projects whenever possible.

My main interests are distributed systems and cloud computing, and I plan on doing research in either field whenever I transfer to a university. Martin Kleppmann's Designing Data-Intensive Applications was the book that made me fell in love with the field, and I have read the book twice by now!

### üçé extracurriculars
At my community college, I am a senator in the student senate's public relations committee. I am also a part of the activities board where we plan a bunch of cool stuff for everyone to attend. 

Aside from that, I am on my feet running 30 miles per week (all of them done easy!) My goal this year is to read a total of 40 [books](https://www.goodreads.com/belzki) this year, and discover 50 new [albums](https://www.last.fm/user/syllabel).
I have a huge interest in **languages** as well, both human and programming. I have a pipe dream of learning one language from each major language family, and if I spend a year focusing on just one language, I will be done by 2035 üò®
